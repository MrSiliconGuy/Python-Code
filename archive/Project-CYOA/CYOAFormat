## Hello and welcome to a demonstration of the CYOA file format
## First of all, any line begining with '##' is 
## always ignored, as if it wasn't there (i.e. Comments)
##
## All files begin with the header shown below
## Following are some meta info tags, all strings after the ':'
#----CYOA----
version:0.9
author: John Doe
##     ^ also valid
## Whitespaces are simply ignored in the meta


## Each story is broken into "pages"
## Each pages has a header, with a name
## 		The name must only consist of alphanumeric characters (case sensitive)
## Lets begin our example!
